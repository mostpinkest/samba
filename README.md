# Samba

Samba docker container

A drop-in replacement for [dperson/samba](https://github.com/dperson/samba) with optional support for [imker25/samba_exporter](https://github.com/imker25/samba_exporter/)

# What is Samba?

Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services
for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS and
Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others.

# How to use this image

This image comes in two variants:
* `mostpinkest/samba:latest`: A modified version of [dperson/samba](https://github.com/dperson/samba), with additional support for a custom config.
* `mostpinkest/samba:exporter`: The same as `mostpinkest/samba:latest` with [imker25/samba_exporter](https://github.com/imker25/samba_exporter/) running alongside it on port `9922`.

> [!WARNING]  
> In its current state, `mostpinkest/samba:exporter` is considered unstable. Do not expect issues to be resolved within any reasonable timeframe. Suggestions and PRs are still welcomed and encouraged.

By default there are no shares configured, additional ones can be added.

## Hosting a Samba instance

    sudo docker run -it -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d mostpinkest/samba -p

OR set local storage:

    sudo docker run -it --name samba -p 139:139 -p 445:445 \
                -v /path/to/directory:/mount \
                -d mostpinkest/samba -p

OR run with exporter:

    sudo docker run -it -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -p 9922:9922 -d \
                mostpinkest/samba:exporter -p

 * `SAMBA_EXPORTER_ARGS` - [Options for `samba_exporter`](https://imker25.github.io/samba_exporter/manpages/samba_exporter.1.html#OPTIONS). Only available with the `exporter` tag.

> [!NOTE]
> If you enable nmbd (via `-n` or the `NMBD` environment variable), you
will also want to expose port 137 and 138 with `-p 137:137/udp -p 138:138/udp`.

> [!NOTE]
> There are reports that `-n` and `NMBD` only work if you have the
container configured to use the hosts network stack.

> [!TIP]
> \*Optionally supports additional variables starting with the same name,
i.e. `SHARE` also will work for `SHARE2`, `SHARE3`... `SHAREx`, etc.

### `smb.conf`

If you wish you use a custom smb.conf file other than the default `smb.conf`, your're able to specfiy a custom `smb.conf` file binded to the path specified by `SMB_CONF_PATH`. Any additional configuration you provide through environment variables or CLI options will be automatically applied to the supplied configuration.

## Examples

Any of the commands can be run at creation with `docker run` or later with
`docker exec -it samba samba.sh` (as of version 1.3 of docker).

### Setting the Timezone

    sudo docker run -it -e TZ=EST5EDT -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d mostpinkest/samba -p

### Start an instance creating users and shares:

    sudo docker run -it -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -v config/smb.conf:/etc/docker-samba/smb.conf -d mostpinkest/samba -p \
                -u "example1;badpass" \
                -u "example2;badpass" \
                -s "public;/share" \
                -s "users;/srv;no;no;no;example1,example2" \
                -s "example1 private share;/example1;no;no;no;example1" \
                -s "example2 private share;/example2;no;no;no;example2"

### Use a custom `smb.conf`

    sudo docker run -it -p 139:139 -p 445:445 -d mostpinkest/samba -p \
                -u "example1;badpass"

# User Feedback

## Troubleshooting

* You get the error `Access is denied` (or similar) on the client and/or see
`change_to_user_internal: chdir_current_service() failed!` in the container
logs.

Add the `-p` option to the end of your options to the container, or set the
`PERMISSIONS` environment variable.

    sudo docker run -it --name samba -p 139:139 -p 445:445 \
                -v /path/to/directory:/mount \
                -d mostpinkest/samba -p

If changing the permissions of your files is not possible in your setup you
can instead set the environment variables `USERID` and `GROUPID` to the
values of the owner of your files.

* High memory usage by samba. Multiple people have reported high memory usage
that's never freed by the samba processes. Recommended work around below:

Add the `-m 512m` option to docker run command, or `mem_limit:` in
docker_compose.yml files, IE:

    sudo docker run -it --name samba -m 512m -p 139:139 -p 445:445 \
                -v /path/to/directory:/mount \
                -d mostpinkest/samba -p

* Attempting to connect with the `smbclient` commandline tool. By default samba
still tries to use SMB1, which is depriciated and has security issues. This
container defaults to SMB2, which for no decernable reason even though it's
supported is disabled by default so run the command as `smbclient -m SMB3`, then
any other options you would specify.
